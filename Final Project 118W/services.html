    <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: white;">Our pet sitting service allows your pet to remain in a familiar, secure environment – your home – while you travel! Our sitter will schedule an initial meeting to gain a clear understanding of your specific needs 
      and to establish trust and confidence with you and your pet. Our visits last approximately thirty minutes each, during which time the sitter will follow your pet’s customary diet and exercise routine and provide personal attention and play time.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: white;">Our dog walking service is designed to help pet parents who work long hours or have after work commitments that can make for an extra long day for their pet or those that have young or elderly pets that would benefit from a bathroom break. 
      Our thirty minute visit focuses on meeting the core needs of your pet while offering an opportunity for extra exercise, play time and attention while you are away.
